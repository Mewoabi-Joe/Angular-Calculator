# Angular Calculator

I ran 'ng build' before making a push to my main branch on github

My calculator can served on this url configured in the github pages section in settings
 https://mewoabi-joe.github.io/Angular-calculator/
 
I am loading the app from my gh-pages branch in the docs folder as specified by the angular documentation. See: https://angular.io/guide/deployment
